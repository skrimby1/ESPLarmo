# ESPLarmo

ESP-based version of Nintendo smart alarm clock "Alarmo", not intended for sale, just a hobby project. This is still in very early stages

The goal of the project is to replicate the functionality of Alarmo, but also add more features that Nintendo haven't implemented.

New Features:
* Mulitple alarms for the week
* Speaker reminder


Current status
* Displays current date and time, in Nintendo design and style.
* Animated sleeping Mario, for nighttime display
