# ESPLarmo

ESP-based version of Nintendo smart alarm clock "Alarmo", not intended for sale, just a hobby project. This is still in very early stages.
Developed in Micropython, which is a high-level language compared to C/C++, so clever memory management is important.

The goal of the project is to replicate the functionality of Alarmo, but also add more features that Nintendo haven't implemented.

New Features:
* Mulitple alarms for the week
* Speaker reminder


Current status
* Displays current date and time, in Nintendo design and style.
* Animated sleeping Mario, for nighttime in Mario 64 theme
* Joystick functionality
* Switching to menu with joystick
